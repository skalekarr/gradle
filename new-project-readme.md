# Getting Started

## Readme 
You should probably include a `readme.md` file (like this one) in the root of your repository with information
on getting the development environment set up and any other relevant information necessary for new
developers on this project.

## Ignoring Files
In your new repository, you might want to start by updating the default `.gitignore` file with 
the appropriate list of ignores for your type of project. Below is a table with the starter `.gitignore` files
for the most common kinds of projects we use on our team. 

| Product | Link |
| ------- | ---- |
| All gitignore files | https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master | 
| IntelliJ / JetBrains | https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/JetBrains.gitignore | 
| Eclipse | https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/Eclipse.gitignore |
